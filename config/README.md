# K8ssandra Script Configuration

1. Edit `config/env.sh` with the details of your setup.

   The individual lines in that file are commented with details about what each setting means.

2. Edit `config/custom-values.yaml` with whatever configuration you wish to supply to Helm.

   See https://k8ssandra.io/docs/reference/ for details on what values can be configured.
